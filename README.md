Visualize 2d and 3d data of a video feed

currently support
- 2d plot of # of R/G/B vs R/G/B
- 3d plot of each colors in the image
- visualize data across frames of the video
- visualize PCA vectors on the current frame of the video
- reduce image colors globally/locally via kmeans and splitting (reduce number of data to plot)
- transform image colors with PCA vectors to reduce color dimension while maintaining almost all variance

plans
- more image analysis techniques (kernels(edges/sharpen/feature locations), general image descriptions)
