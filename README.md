Visualize 2d and 3d data of a video feed

currently support
- 2d plot of # of R/G/B vs R/G/B
- 3d plot of each colors in the image
- visualize data across frames of the video
- reduce image colors globally/locally via kmeans and splitting (reduce number of data to plot)

plans
- more image analysis techniques (PCA, kernels(edges/sharpen/feature locations), image descriptions)
